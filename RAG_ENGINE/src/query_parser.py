INTENT: timetable=schedule/period/timing | subjects=who teaches what/subjects/subject codes/list who teaches subject | faculty=profiles/HOD/count | lab=room/computers/config | calendar=holidays/events/exams | general=other

TIMETABLE SUB-TYPES:
- "schedule of 6A on Monday" / "what does 6A have on Tuesday" → full_day_query: true, class: "6A", day: "Monday"
- "free periods for 6A on Wednesday" / "when is 6A free" → free_period_query: true, class: "6A", day: "Wednesday"
- "what does Dr. X teach" / "Dr. X timetable" / "X mam schedule" → faculty_timetable_query: true, faculty_name: "X"
- "when is DBMS for 6A" / "which period is OS" → subject_schedule_query: true, subject: "expanded name", class: "6A"
- "what is happening on Friday period 3" (no class given) → day: "Friday", period: "3", class: null
- "initials/short form/abbreviation for X"→intent:subjects, subject:X
- "Give today's timetable for 6D"->intent:timetable, date:yyyy-mm-dd,day:today's day,class:6D,full_day_query:True
"what is the timetable of 6D on friday"→{"intent":"timetable","class":"6D","day":"Friday","full_day_query":true}

SUBJECT ABBREVIATIONS (expand always):
DBMS→database management system, OS→operating system, CN→computer networks, DS→data structures, DAA→design and analysis of algorithms, OOP/OOPS→object oriented programming, SE→software engineering, CD→compiler design, TOC→theory of computation, AI→artificial intelligence, ML→machine learning, DM→data mining, BDT→big data technologies, ASD→agile software development, ACA→advanced computer architecture, GT→game theory, PPL→placement practice lab, ARVR/VRAR/virtual reality and augmented reality/virtual reality & augmented reality→"Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality", HPC→high performance computing, CNS→cryptography and network security

DAY/TIME: mon→Monday, tue→Tuesday, wed→Wednesday, thu→Thursday, fri→Friday | "1st/first"→"1", "2nd"→"2", "3rd"→"3" | "10:05AM"→"10:05" | "2pm"→"2pm" | "first class"→"1" | "last class"→"7"
When query contains "(current period is N)" → set period to that exact number N. Never convert a clock time yourself; trust the pre-resolved period number.

CLASS: must be number+letter like 6A, 5B. "6th sem/semester 6"→null. Only number given→null. Only letter given→null. Multiple classes mentioned→null. - Batch pattern: "[class] batch [n]" → class letter repeats, e.g.:
  "6A batch 1"→"6A-A1", "6A batch 2"→"6A-A2", "6A batch 3"→"6A-A3"
  "6B batch 1"→"6B-B1", "6B batch 2"→"6B-B2", "6B batch 3"→"6B-B3"
  "6C batch 1"→"6C-C1", "6C batch 2"→"6C-C2", "6C batch 3"→"6C-C3"
  "6D batch 1"→"6D-D1", "6D batch 2"→"6D-D2", "6D batch 3"→"6D-D3"
  Same pattern for 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D etc.
SUBJECT RULES:
- Subject codes like "22CS61A","22CSE663","22CSL68" → set subject exactly as-is, never expand
- "who teaches X"→intent:subjects, subject:X | "what does X teach"→intent:subjects, faculty_name:X
- "6th sem subjects"→intent:subjects, class:"6" | "6th sem A section"→class:"6A"
- "aiml lab","ai ml lab"→subject:"AI and ML Lab"
- "how many subjects"→is_list_query:false
- "which lab/lab number/what lab for [subject] [class]" → intent:subjects, not intent:lab
- "aiml lab"/"ai ml lab" queries with a class → intent:subjects, subject:"AI and ML Lab" 
- "aiml"/"ai ml" without "lab"→subject:"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning"; with "lab"→subject:"AI and ML Lab"
- Lab subject queries grouped by batch: "6A-A1: [faculty], 6A-A2: [faculty1] and [faculty2], 6A-A3: [faculty1] and [faculty2]
- "what subjects does X take/teach/handle" → intent:subjects, faculty_name:"X", subject:null
- "which subjects does X take/teach/handle" → intent:subjects, faculty_name:"X", subject:null"
- "class teacher of 6D" / "who is class teacher" / "class incharge of 6D/ "class teacher of 6th sem D sec"/ "class teacher of 6th sem D section"" → intent:subjects, is_class_teacher_query:true, class:"6D"
- "list faculties who take/teach [subject]" → intent:subjects

FACULTY RULES:
- Strip honorifics: Dr./Prof./Mr./Mrs./Ms./Sir/Mam/Ma'am → "Dr. Vijaya Shetty"→"Vijaya Shetty", "Deepthi mam"→"Deepthi"

- "show all faculty" → intent: faculty, is_list_query: true, designation: null
- "how many professors"→ designation: "professor, query_type:count"
- "Dileep Reddy sir" → faculty_name: "Dileep Reddy"
- "sir" at end of name must be stripped

CALENDAR RULES:
- Specific date→date:"YYYY-MM-DD" | month only→month:"YYYY-MM" | current year:2026
- All relative date words (today, yesterday, tomorrow, day before yesterday, day after tomorrow,
  morning, afternoon, this week) are pre-resolved by the pipeline BEFORE this parser runs.
  You will see them as YYYY-MM-DD strings or period numbers in the query text — just copy them.
  NEVER try to compute or guess a date yourself.
  Example: "what class does 6A have on 2026-05-27 (Wednesday)" → date:"2026-05-27", day:"Wednesday"
  Example: "is there college on 2026-05-25 (Monday)" → date:"2026-05-25"
  Example: "schedule on 2026-05-26 (Tuesday)" → date:"2026-05-26", day:"Tuesday"
  When query contains "(current period is N)" → period:"N" exactly.
- "when does sem start/classes begin/college reopens"→event_name:"Commencement of Classes"
- "summer vacation duration/how long is summer vacation"→query_type:"gap", event_name:"Summer Vacations", event_name_2:"Registration Odd (5th & 7th) Semester"
- Strip "Starts"/"Ends" from event_name always
-"Unless explicitly labeled as an end date, all dates in the database represent the start date of the event or vacation period."
- "co curricular activity 1/2/first/second" → event_type:"co_curricular", event_name:null, is_list_query:false — never guess the event_name from ordinals
- Only set event_name when user explicitly says the event's actual name (e.g. "Anaadyanta", "MSE-1")

EVENT NAMES: mse1/mse-1/mid sem 1/MSE1/mse 1→"MSE-1" | mse2→"MSE-2" | see theory→"SEE (Theory)" | see practicals→"SEE (Practicals)" | see/end sem/final exam→"SEE (Theory)" | anaadyanta/fest/college fest→"Anaadyanta" | summer vacation→"Summer Vacations" | classes start/coc→"Commencement of Classes" | lwd/last working day/sem end→"Last Working Day" | cie ledger/ledger submission→"CIE Ledger Submission | even semester backlog/backlog registration even/even backlog → Registration for Even Semester Backlog Courses|summer term backlog/summer backlog/backlog summer → Registration Summer Term Backlog Courses"
